# TempTrack-Visual-Analytics
## Summary:
This project visualizes weather data to compare temperature trends across different locations. 
The data is sourced from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI),
providing a rich dataset for climate research and weather analysis.
You can check the results of me runnig the code with data, in the picture file ðŸ“‚.
The code i wrote is on sitka in Alaska, and TLV in Israel.
In the data file ðŸ“‚ you can get the csv file with the needed data, to extract.

#### Data:
The datasets used in this project are downloaded from NOAA's Climate Data Online (CDO) portal,
which offers access to a range of weather and climate data. 
The specific datasets used are daily temperature records for multiple cities,
including maximum, minimum, and average temperatures.
Tha data shows high and low temperatures, and the avarege temperature.

#### Visualization:
The project uses Python's matplotlib library to create line plots that display temperature changes over time.
Each city's data is plotted with high, low, and average temperatures,
allowing for a clear visual comparison between different locations.

#### Insights from the Plots:
The plotted data provides insights into the temperature fluctuations and trends for the selected time period and locations. 
Users can observe patterns such as heatwaves, cold fronts, or consistent climate behavior in specific regions.
This visualization can be used for various applications including climate research, weather forecasting, and educational purposes.

##### Usage
To run the scripts and generate the plots, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
matplotlib
pandas
csv
datetime
######  Replace the placeholders for the CSV file paths with the actual paths to your downloaded NOAA datasets.

#### Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. Please ensure to follow the guidelines for contributing,
which includes using descriptive commit messages and creating a pull request for changes to be reviewed.
